# ChatAppGo

# Sorry for the maintenance

Sorry for the maintenance, the project is based on some packages that are no longer maintained, so it may not work properly or at all over time. I'll probably do a next chat.


## Installation

```go
go get -u github.com/AslakOffi/ChatAppGo/server
go get -u github.com/AslakOffi/ChatAppGo/client

```
## Utilisation

Pour démarrer le serveur :

```go
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/AslakOffi/ChatAppGo
go run server/server.go
```
Pour démarrer un nouveau client :

```go
go run client/client.go
```
